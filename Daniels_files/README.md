We worked to replicate data from this research paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.12816 in order to test its reproducability and authenticity.

The paper documents how differing groups of people were effected by the COVID-19 pandemic. An important factor in theis study was the proportion of people who tested 
positive for COVID and how that affected change in mobility in that subgroup. It's difficult to know with exact certainty which data points they pulled from, even with 
their documentation. We were able to mostly replicate their results albiet with slight variability. 

We managed to:
- Replot their map plots of different sub-populations
- Reproduce the R^2 regression Tables within a decent margin of error




Knowing this makes me wonder how other things might have effected mobility. Perhaps the introduction of the COVID vaccine disproportionately effected mobility in people 
with a higher median salary?
